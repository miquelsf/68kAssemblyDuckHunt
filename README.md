### Overview
Welcome to the **68k Assembly Duck Hunt** repository! ü¶ÜüéÆ

This project was created by 
<a href="https://github.com/AaronTudor-tester" target="_blank">Aaron Tudor</a> 
and 
<a href="https://github.com/miquelsf" target="_blank">Miquel Sans√≥</a> 
as part of our Computer Engineering studies. Building upon a foundational base provided by our professor, 
<a href="https://github.com/aburguera" target="_blank">Antoni Burguera</a>, 
the game captures the essence of the original while prioritizing educational objectives over full gameplay replication.

Developed entirely in 68k Assembly, this project provides deep insights into low-level programming. We utilized the renowned 
<a href="https://www.easy68k.com/" target="_blank">EASy68k</a> 
simulator to design and implement the game, ensuring a realistic environment for development and testing. Through this endeavor, we have enhanced our understanding of the 68k processor architecture and the intricacies of assembly programming.

Whether you're looking to expand your knowledge of assembly language or explore the fundamentals of processor architecture, the 68k Assembly Duck Hunt project offers a practical and engaging learning experience. Feel free to explore the repository and reach out with any questions! üí°
